[00:26.37] Fooled around enough with numbers
[00:29.92] Let's not be ourselves today
[00:33.52] Is it just my imagination
[00:37.27] Is it just someone's face
[00:40.86] Pleasantly out of proportion
[00:45.34] It's hard to hold on to the ground
[00:48.06] Now I didn't come to run
[00:49.81] And this is everything
[00:51.66] And gravity lets you down
[01:04.16] 
[00:56.28] I get wild, wizing up
[01:00.76] I just can't let go
[01:03.45] I get wild when I get ready
[01:09.73] I can hardly talk
[01:12.54] Living lights
[01:13.40] Special lights
[01:16.18] Yellow turns blue
[01:17.94] I get wild It's automatic
[01:23.39] I can hardly move
[01:31.89] 
[01:28.83] Go ahead and pull the curtains
[01:30.68] Check to see if I'm still here
[01:34.21] Let me lose my perspective
[01:37.86] Something worth waiting for
[01:41.45] Somewhere in South Carolina
[01:46.06] And gravity don't mean a thing
[01:49.62] And all around the world
[01:50.85] Each and ev'ryone
[01:52.63] Playing with a heart of steel
[02:07.13] 
[01:56.22] I get up climbing out
[02:00.74] How did I get home?
[02:04.40] I'll survive the situation
[02:08.00] Somebody shut the door
[02:11.61] Beautiful
[02:14.32] Beautiful
[02:17.03] Climbing up the wall
[02:18.89] I get by on automatic
[02:23.48] No surprise at all
[02:32.48] 
[02:58.77] No one here can recognize you
[03:01.45] Here is ev'rything that you like
[03:05.90] Feelings without explanations
[03:09.53] Somethings are hard to describe
[03:13.14] The sound of a cigarette burning
[03:16.76] A place there where ev'rything spins
[03:21.39] And the sounds inside your mind
[03:23.18] Is playing all the time
[03:24.90] Playing with a heart of steel
[03:39.40] 
[03:28.59] I get wild, wizing up
[03:33.06] I just can't let go
[03:35.84] I get wild when I get ready
[03:41.29] I can hardly talk
[03:43.99] Red 'n' white black to gold
[03:48.43] Yellow turns blue
[03:50.70] I get wild It's automatic
[03:55.26] I can hardly move
[04:03.76] 
[03:58.99] I get up pushing up
[04:03.47] How did I get home?
[04:06.19] I'll survive the situation
[04:10.64] Somebody shut the door
[04:14.30] Shut the door
[04:16.11] Shut the door
[04:18.89] Climbing up the wall
[04:21.51] I get by on automatic
[04:26.02] No surprise at all
